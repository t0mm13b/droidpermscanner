droidpermscanner
================

Simple scanner that lexes the Android Java Source and deduces the permissions required to be added into AndroidManifest.xml

There's a new directory called DroidPermScanner which contains the Win32 binaries (both debug/release) that was built using CodeBlocks and MinGW.
